# Media-Knob based off a Pro Micro 32u4 board
Working HID knob with a rotary encoder that can be built on easily 

Had a few hiciups finding something basic that just worked and could be build upon. Went with this sketch and case after some time


Here is a good case that will take both UBS Micro and C style Pro Micro boards

The write up is good as well for their use case.
